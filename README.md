# Phockito integration module for SilverStripe

Phockito was designed to work with SilverStripe, but actually including it in a SilverStripe project can be confusing, as the project itself
is designed to also be useable stand-alone

This module makes installing Phockito into a SilverStripe project as easy as installing any other module - just piston it in, then start
calling Phocktio::mock or Phockito::spy in your tests. Hamcrest comes included by default.
